			Issues
1. SPOF
A single point of failure is a part of a system that, if it fails,
will stop the entire system from working.

2. Downtime when maintenance is needed.
Since the server is using only one code base, there might be long periods of
downtime. Users will not be able to access the website.

3. Cannot scale if too much incoming traffic
The infrastructure lacks a load balancer which helps to handle increase loads.
There will be issues if a high volume of users try to access the website which
would lead to poor user experience.
