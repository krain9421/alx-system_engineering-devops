			Explanations
1. 1. For every additional element, why are we adding it:
A firewall is added for each server to protect from attacks and exploits.
A SSL certificate is added to server 8.8.8.8 (www.foobar.com) over HTTPS.
Three monitoring clients have been added to collect logs and send them to
Sumologic.

2. What are firewalls for:
A firewall is a network security system that monitors and controls
network traffic based on predetermined security rules.
It serves as a barrier between a trusted and untrusted network.

3. Why is the traffic served over HTTPS:
Traffic passed over HTTP is transfered in plain text, while HTTPS
encrypts the data and secures it.

4. What monitoring is used for:
It provides the capability to detect and diagnose any web
application performance issues.

5. How the monitoring tool is collecting data:
Logs are automatically produced and time-stamed with events related
to a particular server. In this infrastructure, all logs of the
application server are collected.

6. Explain what to do if you want to monitor your web server QPS:
To monitor the server from the network and application level

			Issues
1. Why terminating SSL at the load balancer level is an issue:
The data passing across the network from the load balancer to the
App Server are now unencrypted, and that will leave applications
vulnerable to Man-in-the-Middle Attack (MITM).

2. Why having only one MySQL server capable of accepting writes is an issue:
If that MySQL server develops issues, it would mean that data can't
be update and this will cause problems in web applications.

3.Why having servers with all the same components (database, web server and
application server) might be a problem:
An issue with one component in one sever will affect all other servers.
